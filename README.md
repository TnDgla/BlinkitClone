# **Blinkit Clone App: Modern E-Commerce Solution**

This project involves creating a **Blinkit Clone**, an advanced e-commerce application using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The app is fully responsive and includes features like user authentication, product search, category browsing, admin panel for product management, and payment gateway integration. It also supports forgot password functionality, cart management, and order tracking.
